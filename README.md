# IBM-DataScienceCapstone
IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Space X Capstone Project

The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 

In this capstone, I took the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. My job was to determine the price of each launch. I  did this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I also determined if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I trained a machine learning model and used public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
